            <p>A significant international project supported by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is leveraging the Paris 2024 Olympics to enhance weather forecasting research, with researchers at The University of Texas at Austin at the forefront.</p>
            <p>Professor Dev Niyogi of the Jackson School of Geosciences is utilizing AI-based models, running on Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) resources, as part of this ambitious initiative.</p>
            <p>It has been an intensive summer with numerous exciting activities, papers, visitors, and projects underway. Among these, the Paris 2024 Olympics project stands out. Our lab members, including Trevor Brooks, Harsh Kamath, and myself, attended the Paris Olympics/Paralympics WMO Research Demonstration Project (RDP) last year and have since been contributing to the atmospheric urban digital twin initiative. This initiative, organized through the WCRP Digital Earth Lighthouse activity led by Andrew Gettelman, involves a broad, multi-institutional team.</p>
            <p>The UT-Meteogan, which downscales and builds upon the Google Graphcast, is operational for the Paris domain as part of the RDP. This experience has been invaluable, allowing us to interact with global experts and participate in experimental weather forecast discussions and research. More updates on this will follow soon.</p>
